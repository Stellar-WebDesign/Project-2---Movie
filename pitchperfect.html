                   Beca (Anna Kendrick) is that girl who'd rather listen to what's coming out of her headphones than what's coming out of you. 
                   Arriving at her new college, she finds herself not right for any clique but somehow is muscled into one that she never would 
                   have picked on her own: alongside mean girls, sweet girls and weird girls whose only thing in common is how good they sound 
                   when they sing together, in the out-loud comedy "Pitch Perfect."

                    When Beca takes this acoustic singing group out of their world of traditional arrangements and perfect harmonies into all-new 
                    mash-ups, they fight to climb their way to the top of the cutthroat world of college a cappella. This could wind up either 
                    the coolest thing they'll ever do or the most insane, and it will probably be a little of both. This movie debuted in 2012
                    to a mostly positive reception. The story is loosely based on the book "Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate a Cappella Glory"
                    by Mickey Rapkin.
